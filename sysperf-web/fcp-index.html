  <h2>How to use this page and limitations</h2>
  <p>This is a two step process:  first upload the files and then process them.  The uploaded files are not saved but deleted after processing.  This is for security reasons.  After uploading the files, you'll be presented with a button to process the uploaded files.  Processing will start immediately but there will be no page updates until processing is completed.  A link will be created for downloading the generated Excel spreadsheet upon processing completion.
  </p>
  <p>If you need access to older data, simply reupload and reprocess the original files.
